Project Description

Our plan is to create an RPG-style farming simulator game and to document all the necessary 
steps from planning to the launch.

We design it as a game in which the player is put in a scene where it will interact with the 
environment as in, cutting grass, trees, and mining rocks to expand farmable areas. The player 
will have the goal to plant and harvest many types of crops, depending on the season, but with a 
twist.

Whenever a crop overgrows beyond the harvestable state it will try attacking the player. Once 
harvested or beaten the player will have the option to sell the crop and gather coins for upgrades 
in the farm. An example of such an upgrade is the possibility to have a scarecrow as your ally 
that help the character fighting the overgrown crops.
